# Alan Turing- Enigma Question/My_Solution 

Story line: 

The Enigma machine is a cipher gadget created and utilized in the ahead of schedule to mid-twentieth century to ensure business, diplomatic, and military correspondence. 
It was utilized widely by Nazi Germany during The Second World War, in all parts of the German military. 
The Germans accepted, wrongly, that utilization of the Enigma machine empowered them to convey safely and consequently appreciate an immense benefit in 
The Second World War. The Enigma machine was viewed as so secure that even the most highly confidential messages were enciphered on its electrical circuits.

Question: 

The Enigma device has to be resolved by Alan Turing and his team. You have been chosen as one of the smartest minds in the world. 
The device is producing codes like this;

Incoming stream: HHLLHLHLL ——> the expected output: 12543761098

Incoming stream: LLHLLHLL ——> the expected output: 321654987

Incoming stream: HHHHLLLL ——> the expected output: 123498765

Incoming stream: LHLHHH ——> the expected output: 2143567

Alan says "No output digit repeats itself!". 
Write a full code to decrypt this ciphered messages. 

## This code just show solution of alghoritm. Not cover defensive (exception check etc.) clean and performance topic. I just solved and throw it away.
